# PyCFOUR

## A Python interface to the CFOUR electronic structure package

---

There are aspects of CFOUR that make automatic control difficult. This Python package
is designed to help automate and manage calculations, such that all the bookkeeping is
with minimal human effort.

## Planned Features

- Automatic comment and calculation logging
- Pipelining of calculations (e.g. sequential geometry optimization)
- Automatic composite scheme calculations (e.g. HEAT)
- Output parsers to a variety of portable file formats like YAML and JSON
